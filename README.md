# Cog2Runpod
Run any cog project from replicate or any other source via runpod !

## Usage

1. ðŸª£ Create a template with b2 setup as described [here](https://docs.runpod.io/docs/using-s3-to-upload-files-with-serverless)

2. ðŸš€ you can now run any replicate container on runpod by just using as the docker command

```sh
bash -c "source <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealadityashankar/replicate2runpod/main/runpodify.sh)"
```

### Why should you use runpod?

Runpod's cheapest GPU offering costs as much as replicate's CPU offering, so its just, much cheaper
